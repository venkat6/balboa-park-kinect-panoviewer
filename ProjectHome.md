This is a Direct3D panorama viewer developed in Visual Studio C# Express using the official Microsoft Kinect SDK.

This program requires:
Microsoft Windows 7
Microsoft Kinect for XBox 360 with the power adapter for PC.
Microsoft Kinect SDK (http://research.microsoft.com/kinectSDK)
Microsoft Speech Runtime.

This viewer follows hand movements to direct the camera throughout a 3D panorama, the user's hand becomes active when raised above the corresponding hip, two hands raised stops movement. Verbal commands may be given to switch panoramas, currently "Baseball Field" and "Basketball Court" switch to the Point Loma Nazarene University baseball field and basketball court panoramas respectively, and the commands "Restart", or "Reset" return the camera back to its initial position.

This program was developed as part of a Graduate internship at the Balboa Park Online Collaborative for research and educational purposes.
